## 33. Fission as Geometric Renormalization

### 33.1 The Mass Defect in VEF

When a heavy nucleus undergoes fission, the Standard Model attributes 
the released energy to "binding energy" and "neutrino emission." VEF 
provides a geometric reinterpretation.

**Uranium-238 Fission:**
```
U-238 → Th-234 + He-4
Mass lost: 0.0046 amu ≈ 4.28 MeV
```

**VEF Interpretation:**

The mass defect is **NF decompression energy**:

    ΔE = (ρ_NF,compressed - ρ_NF,relaxed) × V_released        (1)

**Physical Mechanism:**

1. **Single Large Cluster (U-238):**
   - Low surface-area-to-volume ratio: S/V ≈ 4πR²/(4πR³/3) = 3/R
   - NF counter-force diluted over small surface
   - High internal NF compression required
   - Large stored potential energy

2. **Two Smaller Clusters (Th-234 + He-4):**
   - Higher combined S/V: (S₁+S₂)/(V₁+V₂) > S_U/V_U
   - NF can "reach" PP nodes more effectively
   - Lower NF compression required
   - Less stored potential energy

**Conservation:**

    ΔE_released = ∫[P_NF,U - (P_NF,Th + P_NF,He)] dV           (2)

This is **pure geometry**—no new particles required.

### 33.2 The NF Re-Tension Pulse

The released energy manifests as a **longitudinal substrate wave**:

**Pulse Properties:**
```
Energy:    E_pulse = 4.28 MeV
Velocity:  v = c (substrate tension wave)
Frequency: ν = E/h ≈ 1.03 × 10²¹ Hz
Charge:    0 (substrate displacement, not PP node)
```

**Propagation:**

The pulse is a **pressure wave** in the NF substrate, analogous to 
a sound wave in air but traveling at c due to the extreme stiffness 
of the vacuum substrate.

**Detection:**

The pulse triggers events only when its amplitude exceeds the 
**venting threshold** of a target PP node (proton):

    P_int(E,L) = P₀ × (|Ψ(E,L)|/A_th)² × Θ(|Ψ| - A_th)        (3)

Where:
- P₀: Base coupling probability
- Ψ(E,L): Pulse amplitude at distance L, energy E  
- A_th: Geometric venting threshold of target proton
- Θ: Heaviside step function (no interaction below threshold)

**Why This Matches Neutrino Observations:**

1. **Rarity:** Most pulses pass through matter (low P_int)
2. **Energy Scale:** 0.5-10 MeV (matches β-decay spectrum)
3. **Directionality:** Radial from source (conserves momentum)
4. **No Charge:** NF displacement, not PP node

### 33.3 Comparison to Standard Model

| Property | Standard Model | VEF Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Energy carrier | Neutrino particle | NF substrate pulse |
| Mass | ~0.1 eV (empirical) | 0 (massless wave) |
| Detection mechanism | Weak force (W/Z bosons) | Resonance threshold |
| Cross-section | σ ∝ E² (empirical fit) | P_int ∝ E² (geometric) |
| Oscillations | Mass mixing (3 flavors) | Eigenmode interference |
| Rarity | Weak coupling constant | Low venting probability |

**Key Advantage:** VEF derives the E² scaling from geometry, 
not empirical fitting.

### 33.4 Experimental Validation

**Prediction:** Reactor neutrino spectrum should match NF pulse 
model without adjustable parameters beyond D_eff = 0.656.

**Test:** KamLAND reactor data (baseline ~180 km, E = 0.5-8 MeV)

Expected curve: R(L,E) ∝ Φ(E) × P_survival(L,E) × P_int(E)

Where P_survival accounts for eigenmode interference (Section 34).

**Falsification Criterion:** If predicted spectrum deviates >5% 
from measured data after fixing D_eff, the substrate pulse model 
is excluded.
